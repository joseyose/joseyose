### Hello there 👋

I am an artist, a perpetual tinkerer and a software engineer.

I find inspiration in the interactions of my daily life, the music I listen to, bike rides, my family and the things I hear and see around our beautiful cosmos. 

Passionate and enthusiastic about programming languages, procedural tools development and building scalable and reliable solutions that provide end-users a more enjoyable day-to-day experience. 

I'm a huge fan of continuous development, automated testing, clean code and simple to use solutions for the betterment of a process or organization.
