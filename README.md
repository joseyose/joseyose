### Hello there 👋

I am an artist, a tinkerer and a software engineer.

I find inspiration in my daily life interactions, the music I listen to, my bike rides, my family and the things I hear and see around this beautiful cosmos. 

Passionate and enthusiastic about programming languages and about building scalable and reliable solutions that provide the end-users a more enjoyable day-to-day experience. 

Currently geeking out more and more about:
- Python
- Rust
- C++
- three.js
- VEX
- AR/VR
- Procedural Tools Development

I'm a huge fan of continuous development, automated testing, clean code and simple to use solutions for the betterment of a process or organization. 

- 🛠 Tools: Python | C++ | Qt5
- 📔 Currently learning more about Docker, and Jenkins.
